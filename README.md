![ASCII_Video_Renderer](https://github.com/i-am-nolan25/CSCI201-Skills-Assignment/assets/113712250/927364e3-efde-43c2-8309-d2ba4ce018f3)

## Overview

The ASCII Video Renderer is a simple web application that converts a live video stream into ASCII art in real-time. It leverages the p5.js library to capture and process video frames, creating a visually appealing ASCII representation. This project serves as a creative and interactive way to explore the fusion of technology and art.

## Project Information

### Course Information

Instructor: Prof. Talmage

Semester: Fall, 2023

Class: CSCI 201 - Computer Science Seminar

### Student Information

Name: Nolan Lwin

Major: Computer Science

## Key Features üöÄ

- Real-time Video to ASCII Art: Transform a live video feed into ASCII art on the fly, providing a unique and dynamic viewing experience.

- Adjustable Font Size: Control the size of the ASCII characters using a convenient slider, allowing users to customize the visual output according to their preferences.

- Pause/Play Toggle: Halt and resume the video stream to freeze a specific frame or resume the mesmerizing flow of evolving ASCII patterns.

- Interactive Styling: External CSS styles provide easy customization, making it simple to modify the appearance of the application without altering the core functionality.

- Single Character Set: Simplified for ease of use, the project currently focuses on a single character set. Users can easily customize the set according to their artistic preferences.

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è

- p5.js Library: Utilized for capturing video from the webcam and processing each frame to create the ASCII art effect.

- HTML5: Used for structuring the web application, including the video container and ASCII art display.

- CSS3: External stylesheets are employed for styling elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

- JavaScript (ES6+): The core logic of the ASCII Video Renderer is implemented in JavaScript, facilitating real-time video processing and interactivity.

- WebRTC: Enabled by p5.js, WebRTC is employed for accessing and capturing the webcam's video stream directly in the browser.

- GitHub: Leveraged for version control and project collaboration, providing a centralized repository for code management.

- CDN: Content Delivery Network links for p5.js and its sound addon, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of necessary libraries.

## How to Run 

Follow these steps to run the ASCII Video Renderer locally:

1. Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ascii-video-renderer.git
cd ascii-video-renderer
```
2. Install VS Code Extension (Optional):

If you're using Visual Studio Code, consider installing the "p5.vscode" extension for improved p5.js support. Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`), then search for "p5.vscode" and install it.

3. Launch Live Server:

- Open the index.html file in Visual Studio Code.
- If you have the "Live Server" extension installed, right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
- Alternatively, you can use other methods to serve the project, such as Python's SimpleHTTPServer or any other static file server.

4. Access the Application:

- Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html).
- Give a permission to your browser to access your webcam
- Experience the real-time transformation of your webcam feed into mesmerizing ASCII art!
